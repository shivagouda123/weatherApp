# Weather App

This Weather App is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap.org(https://openweathermap.org/api) API to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. It provides a clean, responsive UI and displays weather updates dynamically.
